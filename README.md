PokeScala
=========

A Scala wrapper for PokeAPI, making it easy to build Scala apps using information about the Pokemon videogames.

To use the wrapper, you mainly need to get to know the pokescala.model package and the pokescala.net.PokeAPI singleton. Use the PokeAPI singleton to make requests and it will return model instances that you can work with.
